# Cricket-Stadium-Tickets-Management-System
The objective of this project is to build a database consisting of information of all the
cricket stadiums available with each having a set of matches with tickets available.
Each stadium has its own price based on which city it is in and bandwidth of the
ground.
A table consisting of all the matches to be played is listed so that a person can book
easily based on their choice of match.
The database will display all the booked tickets as well along with all the details of
the person who booked the tickets. The stadium venue will depend on the match
played on the certain date and time.
The aim of this project is to make an easy way to view all booked tickets of people
that want to watch their desired matches live in the stadium.
